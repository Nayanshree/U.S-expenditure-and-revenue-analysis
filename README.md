# Expenditure and Revenue Analysis of U.S education system 
### About the data
U.S Revenue and Expenditure Analysis: “us-education-datasets-unification-project” is a Kaggle dataset that provides information about various states of U.S. Some information such as Financial data, Number of students enrolled and average score is provided in the data for different states. Our purpose is to utilize this data efficiently such that the variation of financial data is clear with the variation of other factors mentioned in the data.
### Initial Idea
The aim in the initial stage was to look at the purpose of data. If United States have distributed its data on an open source platform, then their purpose was to gather all the analysis to create a better budget system or revenue system for its states in future. Based on the same, I gathered possible ideas by looking at the dataset available.
1)	How Total Revenue is varying across different states.
2)	How Total Revenue is varying for different years and for different states.
3)	Variation of State Revenue, Federal Revenue and Local Revenue for different years and for different states.
4)	How total number of Enrolled students is varying with the Total Revenue.
5)	How Total Revenue is varying with Total Expenditure for different states.
6)	How Average scores across different states is varying with Total Revenue.
7)	Classify lowest scoring states.
### Analysis approach
1)	To define a map and line chart which can represent all the states and year wise variation for Total Revenue.
2)	To Draw a stacked bar chart which will help to visualize the section of Federal Revenue, Total Revenue and Local Revenue for different years.
3)	To represent a bubble chart to show variation of Total Revenue with number of students enrolled.
### Target audience
1)	State Government
2)	Local Government
3)	Intergovernmental Administration: The administration is responsible for viewing the validity of data and further using this data to analyse the improvements required in different states.
4)	Economic Analyst: These are analysts who belong to the financial department of government. They analyse the revenue generated in any fiscal year.
5)	Internal Revenue Service: The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is the revenue service of the United States federal government. The government agency is a bureau of the Department of the Treasury, and is under the immediate direction of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, who is appointed to a five-year term by the President of the United States.
